Tutorial 1: Reverting a previous commit

Given one or more existing commits, revert the changes that the related patches introduce, and record some new commits that record them. This requires your working tree to be clean (no modifications from the HEAD commit).

For this tutorial a series of modifications and commits will be made to this file. Then one of the intermediate commits will be reverted.
