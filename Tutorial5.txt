This file was created and committed on the master (trunk). Next a branch will be created. This file will be modified on the branch and then the branch will be merged back.


To create a branch call

	$ git branch [branch name]

To switch to that branch call

	$ git checkout [branch name]

To view all the branches you can call

	$ git branch -a

You can switch between the branches using the checkout command.
